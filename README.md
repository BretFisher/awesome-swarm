# Awesome Swarm [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

<img src="images/awesome-swarm.png" align="right" width="250" />

> An awesome list of tools and info on Swarm Mode (SwarmKit)

Swarm (Swarm Mode, SwarmKit) is the simple orchestration and scheduling system built into Moby, Docker Engine, and Mirantis Container Engine (MCE). It is a distributed system that allows you to create and manage a cluster of container runtimes (nodes) and the container workloads running on them.

This Awesome List is maintained by [@BretFisher](https://github.com/BretFisher) and [@s4ke](https://github.com/s4ke). This is a curated list of *working* and *awesome* tools and resources for using Swarm. It is not an official list, but a community effort to help people find the best stuff for Swarm in 2023 and beyond.

### Volumes and Storage

Swarm previously only supported local volumes, NFS, and a limited set of Docker Engine Plugin drivers that supported Swarm Mode. Driver support has dwindled over time as vendors moved to Kubernetes. In 2023, with the Docker Engine v23.x release, Docker Engine and Swarm Mode gained the Container Storage Interface (CSI) standard. Existing CSI drivers will need to add Swarm support.
